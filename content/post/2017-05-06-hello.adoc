Due to popular demand, and the fact I wrote myself into it in the last release notes,
I'm starting a blog now. Astute observers may notice that this blog was requested last
release, but I completely forgot about it.

I'm a *NIX user/programmer who really doesn't like much else footnote:[Yes Mac OSX is
unix, but how could I possible like an OS which ships a 7 year outdated bash verison?]
operating system wise. I administer a small home server and handle releases over at the
coala project. As far as I am concerned, Cisco low end consumer gear and low end business 
gear is absolute crap (the ASA 5505 is a particular offender). I permanently switched to 
Linux after Windows 10 made it clear it wanted to be one giant piece of spyware (I had
been a long time Linux user before).

This blog will mainly contain technical writeups on coala releases. I might end up
adding other things over time like GSOC or other events. This will not be a personal
blog (I'm hoping) and thus will not have any life story, philosophy, etc. I'll mainly
writing this in my free time so the posting frequency will probably be very erratic.

This blog is powered by Hugo, using asciidoc as the markup language. So far, Hugo has
been pretty impressive; the generation time is ridiculously low for the few stress tests
I've run so far. Initially, was going to try pelican since it was written in python and
was supposedly light and fast. However, I couldn't find a theme with the capabilities I
wanted so I chose Hugo.

As you can see from a first glance, it's pretty stock theming options. I kept nearly
all of the CSS which shipped with the theme since my design aesthetic really sucks (I
should have failed art). However, I did tweak some of the linking and HTML to make the
site more intuitive (I hope...) I still plan on  touching up few more things like the
side bar and other assorted bits to look slightly nicer. Expect more on the technical
details in future blog posts.

Anyways, this post has gone on long enough, so I'll end it here. Expect a blog post on
coala's 0.11.0rc2 soon.
